After installing iPython Notebook, navigate to the folder containing Toonz.ipynb in your terminal. On the command line enter: 	ipython notebook Toonz.ipynbThe notebook containing our code should open in your default web browser. In order to run all of the code, click the dropdown labeled Cell on the Navigation Bar at the top of the page. Then select Run All. In order to run, our code requires that the data set and included images be in the same directory as our ipynb file. Therefore, we have included these in the current directory instead of the report directory.The results outputted as the code runs indicates how it functions, how accurate our model is and produces our results.
